This is a very simple but yet working framework.
Using smarty as template management

All requests are going with the $_GET variable.
The values are checked and validated. If successful the right php and template file will be loaded.

e.g.
index.php?p=start

will load the start.php and start.html file as template and display all via the main.html file
